# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are at a high risk of canceling their subscription, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain those customers.

## Overview

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or service. For subscription-based businesses, understanding and predicting churn is essential for maintaining a stable customer base and maximizing revenue. By predicting churn, companies can tailor their marketing and customer service efforts to reduce attrition and improve customer retention.

This project utilizes historical data on customer behavior, service interactions, and subscription details to build a predictive model using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The model identifies patterns and trends associated with churn, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers' subscription history, activity levels, customer service interactions, and whether or not the customer churned. The key features of the dataset are:

- Subscription History: The number of months the customer has been subscribed to the service.
- Activity Logs: The frequency and volume of customer interactions with the platform or service.
- Customer Service Interactions: The number of interactions between the customer and the customer service team, which could indicate dissatisfaction.
- Churn: The target variable indicating whether the customer churned (1) or did not churn (0).

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing Value Handling: Missing data is handled using imputation techniques (mean or median imputation) to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
- Feature Scaling: The features are standardized using scaling techniques to bring all features to the same scale, which is particularly important for models like Random Forest that rely on distance and tree-building algorithms.
- Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables, such as region or subscription type, are encoded using appropriate techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).

### Model Building
The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn. The Random Forest algorithm is chosen due to its ability to handle both classification and regression tasks, its robustness to overfitting, and its interpretability. Random Forest models are ensembles of decision trees that make predictions by aggregating the outputs of many individual trees.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
- Recall: The proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

### Key Insights
By analyzing the churn predictions, companies can:
- Identify High-Risk Customers: The model highlights customers who are most likely to churn, enabling targeted retention efforts.
- Improve Customer Service: The frequency of customer service interactions may correlate with churn. Identifying customers with many service interactions can prompt businesses to intervene early.
- Optimize Marketing Strategies: By recognizing patterns in customer behavior and subscription history, businesses can craft personalized offers or retention strategies to reduce churn.

## Objective

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a tool that can predict customer churn based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning, businesses can:
- Proactively identify customers at risk of leaving.
- Tailor interventions to retain these customers.
- Reduce overall churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

Predicting customer churn is an essential aspect of managing a subscription-based business. This model serves as a step toward implementing data-driven retention strategies. The insights generated from this analysis can be used to enhance customer satisfaction, tailor marketing campaigns, and ultimately increase the lifetime value of customers.
